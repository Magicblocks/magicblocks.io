This device is an Integrated development platform for learning and solution designing of electronics, robotics, Internet of Things and coding. The device can interact with a host of sensors such as light sensors, fire sensors, motion detectors etc. and output devices such as LEDs, switches, buzzers, speakers, motors etc. The hardware can be programmed using industry standard integrated development environment (IDE) that runs on PCs, Tablets, Mobile devices, or web platforms. This device supports a large number of programming platforms such as C++, python, scratch, magicblocks, mblock and codda, Hence the learning curve to learn to operate and utilize this device is shorter. Ardunio & MicroPython are for users with prior programming experience. Magicbit provides extension for mBlock3 for kids without programming knowledge. Codda is a visual programming language which same time can experience the true coding. Magicblocks is a NodeRed based platform for IoT solution design for any user group.
 
This device also has the following special features:

- In-built battery charger, WiFi & Bluetooth connectivity;
- Integrated sensors and actuators to enable users to test and design projects without additional components;
- An internal OLED display;
- Plug & play feature to easily connect accessories;
- An enclosure for productization of designs

Brain of the Magicbit is ESP32, which is a series of low-cost, low-power system on a chip microcontrollers with integrated Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth. Therefore any project or document available on internet which supports ESP32 is supported for Magicbit as well.




Any ioT creation you want to connect with nodes without any coding and your project running in the cloud platform the development board you use will not have much memory or more processing capability, unless you want to create Image Processing, Character Recognizing, DB Handling, you can create any project on it.

You can also create attractively online dashboards online without any coding

Magicblocks.io Dashboard
========================

In Magicblocks you can also create Web based-dashboards attractively for your IoT designs without any codes. 
You need to connect the necessary widgets to the dashboard that you want and to configure the settings you need to reach them. 
Then, you can access your Online Dashboard from the dashboard menu on your dashboard, where you can click on the URL in the browser to access the Dashboard via any Device Device such as Smart Phone, Tablet, PC.

What is Internet of Things
*****************************************************

The `Internet of things <https://www.iotforall.com/what-is-iot-simple-explanation/>`_ is nothing new. It is an evolutionary next step in the machine to machine communication paradigm. With an ever increasing number of 'things' at our disposal the need for connected 'things' has grown rapidly. However with increasing options comes added complexity which introduces steep learning curves and more importantly more confusion. What devices should I use? What cloud platform will best server my interest? I am new to IoT where should I start? Those are the question that would linger in any one who would dare to wonder in to the internet of Things. We, at `magicblocks.io <http://magicblocks.io>`_ have put some magic to work to make the life of both the newcomer and the professional one step easier.

Hardware
*****************

LED
-------
There is a micro USB port on the back of the Magicbit.Connect the micro USB port to a mobile phone charger or computer through a cable and it will draw power required for the board to function and it also used program magibit and data transferring with a computer.

WiFi
----

WiFi is a technology that uses radio waves to provide network connectivity. Magicbit consists with wifi module. WiFi  technology has widely spread lately and you can get connected almost anywhere; at home, at work, in libraries, schools, airports, hotels and even in some restaurants enabling IOT connectivity capabilities.


BLUETOOTH
---------

Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard used for exchanging data between fixed and mobile devices over short distances using short-wavelength UHF radio waves.
Magicbit consists with wifi module which enables IOT connectivity capabilities
