This device is an Integrated development platform for learning and solution designing of electronics, robotics, Internet of Things and coding. The device can interact with a host of sensors such as light sensors, fire sensors, motion detectors etc. and output devices such as LEDs, switches, buzzers, speakers, motors etc. The hardware can be programmed using industry standard integrated development environment (IDE) that runs on PCs, Tablets, Mobile devices, or web platforms. This device supports a large number of programming platforms such as C++, python, scratch, magicblocks, mblock and codda, Hence the learning curve to learn to operate and utilize this device is shorter. Ardunio & MicroPython are for users with prior programming experience. Magicbit provides extension for mBlock3 for kids without programming knowledge. Codda is a visual programming language which same time can experience the true coding. Magicblocks is a NodeRed based platform for IoT solution design for any user group.
 
This device also has the following special features:

- In-built battery charger, WiFi & Bluetooth connectivity;
- Integrated sensors and actuators to enable users to test and design projects without additional components;
- An internal OLED display;
- Plug & play feature to easily connect accessories;
- An enclosure for productization of designs

Brain of the Magicbit is ESP32, which is a series of low-cost, low-power system on a chip microcontrollers with integrated Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth. Therefore any project or document available on internet which supports ESP32 is supported for Magicbit as well.
