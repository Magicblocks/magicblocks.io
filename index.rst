What is Magicblocks.io 
***************************

magicbicblocks.io is an easy-to-use IoT platform that supports ESP32-based development boards and utilizes Node-RED, a visual programming tool that allows for drag-and-drop connection of different IoT devices and services, eliminating the need for complex coding. The platform offers pre-built blocks and sample applications, supports a variety of sensors and actuators, and provides cloud-based data storage and remote access. Overall, magicbicblocks.io is a powerful tool for anyone looking to quickly prototype and develop IoT applications.

How Magicblocks works
=============================

The three main components of IoT are devices, cloud, and connectivity. Devices are the physical objects that are embedded with sensors and software that collect and exchange data. Cloud refers to the remote servers where this data is stored and analyzed. Connectivity is the means by which these devices and cloud services communicate, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or cellular networks. 
In a system using magicblocks, it acts as the cloud component, where data is stored and analyzed. The devices component is fulfilled by using ESP32-based hardware which are embedded with sensors and software. The connectivity method used is WiFi, which enables the communication between the devices and the cloud. Together, these components make it possible to create a smart system that can be monitored and controlled remotely.

*************************
Playground 
*************************

Go to the playground!
=======================

- Login to Magicblocks and click on Playground Button to open the playground. To open the playground you should have started it from the home page.

.. image:: Images/openplayground.PNG

- The playground is a hosted instance of a customized version of the open source Node-Red application. On the left you will find the palette where all the blocks will reside. You can drag and drop the blocks from the palette to the canvas and start rolling very quickly. Once done click the **Deploy** button on the top right corner and all your changes will be saved. In the next section we will go through some examples covering all the relevant blocks

.. image:: Images/blankplayground.PNG


.. .. image:: https://github.com/magicbitlk/Magicbit-Magicblocks.io/blob/master/Images/3-1024x576.jpg?raw=true

The editor window consists of four components:

- The header at the top, containing the deploy button, main menu, and, if user authentication is enabled, the user menu.
- The palette on the left, containing the nodes available to use.
- The main workspace in the middle, where flows are created.
- The sidebar on the right.

.. image:: https://github.com/magicbitlk/Magicbit-Magicblocks.io/blob/master/Images/editor-default-components-1024x683.png?raw=true

The main workspace is where flows are developed by dragging nodes from the palette and wiring them together.
The workspace has a row of tabs along the top; one for each flow and any subflows that have been opened.


Flow
====

.. image:: https://github.com/magicbitlk/Magicbit-Magicblocks.io/blob/master/Images/editor-flow-tabs.png?raw=true


Adding a flow
-------------

.. |plus_icon| image:: https://github.com/magicbitlk/Magicbit-Magicblocks.io/blob/master/Images/plus.png?raw=true
    :width: 12px

To add a new flow, click the  |plus_icon|  button in the top bar.


Nodes
======
Nodes can be added to the workspace by either:


- Dragging them from the palette
- Using the quick-add dialog
- Importing from the library or clipboard

Nodes are joined together by wires via their ports. A node can have at most one input port and many output ports. A port may have a label that is displayed when the mouse hovers over it. A node may specify labels, for example, the Switch node shows the rule that matches the port. The labels can also be customised in the node edit dialog.

.. image:: https://github.com/magicbitlk/Magicbit-Magicblocks.io/blob/master/Images/editor-node-port-label.png?raw=true


Some nodes display a status message and icon below the node. This is used to indicate the runtime state of the node - for example, the MQTT nodes indicate if they are currently connected or not.

.. image:: https://github.com/magicbitlk/Magicbit-Magicblocks.io/blob/master/Images/editor-node-details.png?raw=true


If a node has any undeployed changes, it displays a blue circle above it. If there are errors with its configuration, it displays a red triangle.

Some nodes include a button on either its left or right edge. These allow some interaction with the node from within the editor. The Inject and Debug nodes are the only core nodes that have buttons.




Editing node configuration
==========================

A nodeâ€™s configuration can be edited by double clicking on the node, or pressing **Enter** when the workspace has focus. If multiple nodes are selected, the _first_ node in the selection will be edited.

Every block that interact with your Magicbit has a property called Device ID where you need to specify to which device this block belongs to. This is important because you will be working with multiple devices in a typical IoT project. You can find device ID from magicblocks device manager.

For most nodes that interact with the Magicbit, a PIN has to be specified. This let's the Magicbit know which pin the device you intend to use is connected to.

Other than these, different blocks may have additional properties depending on which parameters are required to be specified to achieve the intended outcome from the device.

.. .. image:: https://github.com/magicbitlk/Magicbit-Magicblocks.io/blob/master/Images/editor-edit-node.png?raw=true
..     :width: 400px

Wires
=====

Nodes are wired together by pressing the left-mouse button on a nodeâ€™s port, dragging to the destination node and releasing the mouse button.

.. image:: https://github.com/magicbitlk/Magicbit-Magicblocks.io/blob/master/Images/editor-node-wire.png?raw=true

Alternatively, if the **Ctrl/Command** key is held down, the left-mouse button can be clicked (and released) on a nodeâ€™s port and then clicked on the destination. If the **Ctrl/Command** key remains held and the just-wired destination node has an output port, a new wire is started from that port. This allows a set of nodes to be quickly wired together.

This can also be combined with the Quick-Add dialog that is triggered by a **Ctrl/Command-Click** on the workspace to quickly insert new nodes and have them already wired to previous nodes in the flow.


Import & Export
===============

Flows can be imported and exported from the editor using their JSON format, making it very easy to share flows with others.

Importing flows
---------------

To import a flow, open the Import dialog, paste in the flow json and click â€˜Importâ€™.

The â€˜Importâ€™ button will only be active if valid JSON is pasted into the dialog.

The dialog also offers the option to import the nodes into the current flow, or to create a new flow for them.

.. image:: https://github.com/Magicblocks/magicblocks.io/blob/master/Images/editor-import.png?raw=true


Exporting flows
---------------

The Export dialog can be used to copy flow json out of the editor.

It can export either the selected nodes, the current flow (including its tab node) or the complete flow configuration.

It offers the option to export compact or formatted JSON. The compact option generates a single line of JSON with no whitespace. The formatted JSON option is formatted over multiple lines with full indentation - which can be easier to read.

***********
Core Blocks
***********

The Magicblocks palette includes a default set of nodes that are the basic building blocks for creating flows. This page highlights the core set you should know about.

All nodes include documentation you can see in the Info sidebar tab when you select a node.

- Inject
- Debug
- Function
- Change
- Switch
- Template

Inject node
============

.. image:: https://github.com/magicbitlk/Magicbit-Magicblocks.io/blob/master/Images/node_inject.png?raw=true


The Inject node can be used to manual trigger a flow by clicking the nodeâ€™s button within the editor. It can also be used to automatically trigger flows at regular intervals.

The message sent by the Inject node can have its **payload** and **topic** properties set.

The **payload** can be set to a variety of different types:

- a flow or global context property value
- a String, number, boolean, Buffer or Object
- a Timestamp in milliseconds since January 1st, 1970

Debug node
===========
.. image:: https://github.com/magicbitlk/Magicbit-Magicblocks.io/blob/master/Images/node_debug.png?raw=true


The Debug node can be used to display messages in the Debug sidebar within the editor.

The sidebar provides a structured view of the messages it is sent, making it easier to explore the message.

Alongside each message, the debug sidebar includes information about the time the message was received and which Debug node sent it. Clicking on the source node id will reveal that node within the workspace.

The button on the node can be used to enable or disable its output. It is recommended to disable or remove any Debug nodes that are not being used.

The node can also be configured to send all messages to the runtime log, or to send short (32 characters) to the status text under the debug node.

The page on Working with messages gives more information about using the Debug sidebar.

Function node
==============

.. image:: https://github.com/magicbitlk/Magicbit-Magicblocks.io/blob/master/Images/node_function.png?raw=true


The Function node allows JavaScript code to be run against the messages that are passed through it.

A complete guide for using the Function node is `available here <https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/writing-functions>`_
.

Change node
================

.. image:: https://github.com/magicbitlk/Magicbit-Magicblocks.io/blob/master/Images/node_change.png?raw=true

The Change node can be used to modify a messageâ€™s properties and set context properties without having to resort to a Function node.

Each node can be configured with multiple operations that are applied in order. The available operations are:

- **Set** - set a property. The value can be a variety of different types, or can be taken from an existing message or context property.
- **Change** - search and replace parts of a message property.
- **Move** - move or rename a property.
- **Delete** - delete a property.
- **When** setting a property, the value can also be the result of a JSONata expression. JSONata is a declarative query and transformation language for JSON data.

Switch node
===========

.. image:: https://github.com/magicbitlk/Magicbit-Magicblocks.io/blob/master/Images/node_switch.png?raw=true


The Switch node allows messages to be routed to different branches of a flow by evaluating a set of rules against each message.

The node is configured with the property to test - which can be either a message property or a context property.

There are four types of rule:

- **Value** rules are evaluated against the configured property
- **Sequence** rules can be used on message sequences, such as those generated by the Split node
- A JSONata **Expression** can be provided that will be evaluated against the whole message and will match if the expression returns a _true_ value.
- An **Otherwise** rule can be used to match if none of the preceding rules have matched.
The node will route a message to all outputs corresponding to matching rules. But it can also be configured to stop evaluating rules when it finds one that matches.

Dashboards
**********

What is Magicblocks Dashboard?
==============================

**Magicblocks** Dashboard is a module that provides a set of nodes in **Magicblocks** to quickly create a live data dashboard.

Since **Magicblocks** is based on NODE-RED opensource platform you can learn more about dashboard using following links

- http://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-dashboard
- https://github.com/node-red/node-red-dashboard

.. image:: https://github.com/magicbitlk/Magicbit-Magicblocks.io/blob/master/Images/dashboard_nodes.png?raw=true


Nodes from the dashboard section provide widgets that show up in your application user interface (UI).

The user interface is organized in tabs and groups. Tabs are different pages on your user interface, like several tabs in a browser. Inside each tab you have groups that divide the tabs in different sections so that you can organize your widgets.

Every widget should have an associated group that determines where the widget should appear on the user interface.

To create a tab and a group follow the following instructions (see figure below):

* On top right corner of the **Magicblocks** window you have a tab called dashboard.
* Select that tab **(1)**. To add a tab to the user interface click on the +tab button **(2)**.
* Once created, you can edit the tab by clicking on the edit button **(3)**

.. image:: https://github.com/magicbitlk/Magicbit-Magicblocks.io/blob/master/Images/dashboard_and_nodes.PNG?raw=true


**You can edit the tabâ€™s name and change its icon**

- Name: you can call it whatever you want
- Icon:  you should use a name accordingly to the iconâ€™s names in this link: https://klarsys.github.io/angular-material-icons

.. image:: https://github.com/magicbitlk/Magicbit-Magicblocks.io/blob/master/Images/edit-tab.png?raw=true


- After creating a tab, you can create several groups under that tab. You need to create at least one group to add your widgets. To add a group to the created tab, you need to click on the +group button **(4)**.

- Then, you can edit the created group by clicking on the edit button **(5)**.

.. image:: https://github.com/magicbitlk/Magicbit-Magicblocks.io/blob/master/Images/group-properties.png?raw=true


- You can edit its name, select its corresponding tab and change its width.


Creating a User Interface â€“ Example
===================================

In this section weâ€™re going to make a dashboard example to show you how you can build and edit your own dashboard â€“ we wonâ€™t actually add functionalities to the widgets â€“ weâ€™ll do that in future projects. This dashboard will have the following features

- Two different tabs: one called Room and another called Garden
- The Room tab will have two groups and the Garden tab will have one group
- Weâ€™ll add a color picker and a switch to the room groups
- Weâ€™ll add a chart to the Garden group

Creating the Tabs
==============================

On the top right corner on the Magicblocks window, select the **dashboard** tab and create two new tabs by clicking on the **+tab** button.

Edit one tab with the following properties

- **Name:** Room
- **Icon:** tv

And the other one with the following

- Name: Garden
- Icon: local_florist

Then, add two groups to the Room tab and one group to the Garden tab. The following figure shows how your dashboard layout looks.

.. image:: https://github.com/magicbitlk/Magicbit-Magicblocks.io/blob/master/Images/dashboard-layout.png?raw=true


Adding the Widgets
==============================

Add a switch, a slider, a colour picker and a gauge to the flow as show in the following figure
.. image:: https://github.com/magicbitlk/Magicbit-Magicblocks.io/blob/master/Images/flow.png?raw=true


Double click on the switch. A new window pops up.

.. image:: https://github.com/magicbitlk/Magicbit-Magicblocks.io/blob/master/Images/switch.png?raw=true


In this new window you can choose where you want your button widget to appear. In this case we want it to appear in the Room tab, Group 1 as highlighted in red in the previous figure.

Then, do the same for the other widgets but add them to the following groups:

- **slider:** Group 1 [Room]
- **color picker:** Group 2 [Room]
- **gauge:** Group 1 [Garden]
