What is Internet of Things
*****************************************************

The `Internet of things <https://www.iotforall.com/what-is-iot-simple-explanation/>`_ is nothing new. It is an evolutionary next step in the machine to machine communication paradigm. With an ever increasing number of 'things' at our disposal the need for connected 'things' has grown rapidly. However with increasing options comes added complexity which introduces steep learning curves and more importantly more confusion. What devices should I use? What cloud platform will best server my interest? I am new to IoT where should I start? Those are the question that would linger in any one who would dare to wonder in to the internet of Things. We, at `magicblocks.io <http://magicblocks.io>`_ have put some magic to work to make the life of both the newcomer and the professional one step easier.

***************************

Playground 
*************************

.. image:: https://github.com/magicbitlk/Magicbit-Magicblocks.io/blob/master/Images/3-1024x576.jpg?raw=true

The editor window consists of four components:

- The header at the top, containing the deploy button, main menu, and, if user authentication is enabled, the user menu.
- The palette on the left, containing the nodes available to use.
- The main workspace in the middle, where flows are created.
- The sidebar on the right.

.. image:: https://github.com/magicbitlk/Magicbit-Magicblocks.io/blob/master/Images/editor-default-components-1024x683.png?raw=true

The main workspace is where flows are developed by dragging nodes from the palette and wiring them together.
The workspace has a row of tabs along the top; one for each flow and any subflows that have been opened.


Flow
====
.. image:: https://github.com/magicbitlk/Magicbit-Magicblocks.io/blob/master/Images/editor-flow-tabs.png?raw=true


Adding a flow
-------------

To add a new flow, click the 
.. image:: https://github.com/magicbitlk/Magicbit-Magicblocks.io/blob/master/Images/plus.png?raw=true

button in the top bar.

Editing flow properties
-----------------------

To edit a flow’s properties, double-click on its tab in the top bar. This will open the Flow Properties dialog.

Within the dialog, the flow’s name and description can be set. The description can use Markdown syntax for formatting and will appear in the Information sidebar.

The Status property can be used to disable or enable the flow.

.. image:: https://github.com/magicbitlk/Magicbit-Magicblocks.io/blob/master/Images/editor-edit-flow.png?raw=true


Deleting a flow
---------------

To delete a flow, click the ‘Delete’ button in the Flow Properties dialog.



Nodes
======
Nodes can be added to the workspace by either:


- Dragging them from the palette
- Using the quick-add dialog
- Importing from the library or clipboard

Nodes are joined together by wires via their ports. A node can have at most one input port and many output ports. A port may have a label that is displayed when the mouse hovers over it. A node may specify labels, for example, the Switch node shows the rule that matches the port. The labels can also be customised in the node edit dialog.

.. image:: https://github.com/magicbitlk/Magicbit-Magicblocks.io/blob/master/Images/editor-node-port-label.png?raw=true


Some nodes display a status message and icon below the node. This is used to indicate the runtime state of the node - for example, the MQTT nodes indicate if they are currently connected or not.

.. image:: https://github.com/magicbitlk/Magicbit-Magicblocks.io/blob/master/Images/editor-node-details.png?raw=true


If a node has any undeployed changes, it displays a blue circle above it. If there are errors with its configuration, it displays a red triangle.

Some nodes include a button on either its left or right edge. These allow some interaction with the node from within the editor. The Inject and Debug nodes are the only core nodes that have buttons.

Quick-Add dialog
----------------


The Quick-Add dialog provides an easy way to add a node to the workspace wherever the mouse is, without having to drag it over from the palette.

The dialog is opened by holding the **Ctrl** or **Command** key when clicking on the workspace.

The dialog contains a complete list of all nodes available to add. It shows the five main core nodes at the top of the list, followed by any recently added nodes and finally a complete, alphabetical, list of the remaining nodes.

As with the main palette, the dialog has an input at the top to filter the list and quickly find a node.

.. image:: https://github.com/magicbitlk/Magicbit-Magicblocks.io/blob/master/Images/editor-quick-add.png?raw=true



Editing node configuration
==========================

A node’s configuration can be edited by double clicking on the node, or pressing **Enter** when the workspace has focus. If multiple nodes are selected, the _first_ node in the selection will be edited.

.. image:: https://github.com/magicbitlk/Magicbit-Magicblocks.io/blob/master/Images/editor-edit-node.png?raw=true

 
.. image:: https://github.com/magicbitlk/Magicbit-Magicblocks.io/blob/master/Images/editor-edit-node-settings.png?raw=true


The node edit dialog has two separate sections; properties and settings. The properties section shows the edit form specific to the node type being edited. The settings section shows the common settings that can be set on all nodes. This includes the custom port labels as well as the icon for the node.

Clicking on the icon shows the Node icon picker that can be used to select the icon for the node from the list of all available icons.

.. image:: https://github.com/magicbitlk/Magicbit-Magicblocks.io/blob/master/Images/editor-edit-node-settings-icon.png?raw=true


Configuration nodes
-------------------

A Configuration (config) Node is a special type of node that holds reusable configuration that can be shared by regular nodes in a flow.

For example, the MQTT In and Out nodes use an MQTT Broker config node to represent a shared connection to an MQTT broker.

Configuration nodes are added through the edit dialog of a node that requires the config node. It will have a field to select from the available config nodes of the required type or to add a new instance.
.. image:: https://github.com/magicbitlk/Magicbit-Magicblocks.io/blob/master/Images/editor-edit-node-config-node.png?raw=true


Clicking the button next to the select box will open the edit dialog for the selected node, or add a new instance.

.. image:: https://github.com/magicbitlk/Magicbit-Magicblocks.io/blob/master/Images/editor-edit-config-node.png?raw=true


The config node edit dialog only has the node properties section - as a config node has no icon or ports to set labels on.

In the footer of the dialog is an indication of how many nodes use this config node. It also provides a select box to set the scope of the config node. The scope determines which flows the config node is available on. By default it is available on all flows, but the select box can be used to make it local to just one flow.

The Configuration Nodes Sidebar can be used to manage all config nodes.

Wires
=====

Nodes are wired together by pressing the left-mouse button on a node’s port, dragging to the destination node and releasing the mouse button.

.. image:: https://github.com/magicbitlk/Magicbit-Magicblocks.io/blob/master/Images/editor-node-wire.png?raw=true

Alternatively, if the **Ctrl/Command** key is held down, the left-mouse button can be clicked (and released) on a node’s port and then clicked on the destination. If the **Ctrl/Command** key remains held and the just-wired destination node has an output port, a new wire is started from that port. This allows a set of nodes to be quickly wired together.

This can also be combined with the Quick-Add dialog that is triggered by a **Ctrl/Command-Click** on the workspace to quickly insert new nodes and have them already wired to previous nodes in the flow.

Splitting wires
---------------

If a node with both an input and output port is dragged over the mid-point of a wire, the wire is draw with a dash. If the node is then dropped, it is automatically inserted into the flow at that point.

.. image:: https://github.com/magicbitlk/Magicbit-Magicblocks.io/blob/master/Images/editor-wiring-splice.png?raw=true


Moving wires
------------

To disconnect a wire from a port, select the wire by clicking on it, then press and hold the **Shift** key when the left-mouse button is pressed on the port. When the mouse is then dragged, the wire disconnects from the port and can be dropped on another port. If the mouse button is released over the workspace, the wire is deleted.

If a port has multiple wires connected to it, if none of them is selected when button is pressed with the **Shift** key held, all of the wires will move.

Deleting wires
--------------

To delete a wire, first select it by clicking on it and then press the **delete** key.
